  *Techlahoma does not automatically share attendee information with sponsors. This includes contact information and demographic data. Attendees may “opt-in” for their information to be shared, and we will release that information if noted in the sponsorship tier. Note that we offer social media shout out opportunities and advertising throughout the conference, but all contact with attendees comes directly from official Techlahoma/200OK Conference communication channels.*
