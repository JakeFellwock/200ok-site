## Conference History and Mission

200OK is one of Oklahoma’s longest running web developer-focused conferences. Since 2013, 200OK has brought in industry experts from around the world to speak about web technologies. 

## Target Audience

Our audience is interested in the newest web technologies and tools. We are very welcoming, with talks at both introductory and intermediate levels. 

Topics usually include:

- Front-End (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.)
- Back End (Node, Python/Django, C#/.Net, Ruby/Rails, SQL, No SQL, etc.)
- DevTools and infrastructure (Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD, etc.)
- Design (UX, UI, Design thinking)
- New technologies (Machine learning, algorithms, etc.) 
- Project Management (Agile, etc)
- Soft Skills

## Attendance

For 2021, we are expecting attendance of 150-200 developers and IT professionals.  We tend to get all sorts of attendees including front-end developers, back-end developers, business/startup owners, and project/product managers. The following is our attendance in previous years:

- 2020 - Virtual - 250

## 2021 is Virtual

2021 will be a “virtual first” conference, meaning all speakers and sponsor talks will be remote and attendees will be able to experience the full event online, but depending on the state of COVID and state/local health guidelines, we may organize small-group ‘watch parties’ where attendees can gather safely and participate.

- We can provide a 5-minute speaking slot for all Gold, Silver, and Lunch level sponsors.
- We would like to give attendees coupons for a delivery service (DoorDash, UberEats, etc.) in lieu of lunch that day.
  - If this interests you, please see the Lunch Sponsorship level.
- Since this is a virtual conference, we will have a “pay what you want” ticket tier, but paid tickets (past a certain amount) will receive a t-shirt and swag.
  - We order these and ship to attendees after the conference and should be received by attendees within a few weeks. Sponsors may provide additional items for the swag bags, but they must deliver them to us by the day of the conference.
- Techlahoma does not share attendee information with sponsors. This includes contact information and demographic data. Note that we offer social media shout out opportunities and advertising throughout the conference, but all contact with attendees comes directly from official Techlahoma/200OK Conference communication channels. 
- Sponsors are encouraged to provide high quality logo graphics and a short write-up that can be shared both before, during and after the conference.
